<p6>A digit recognition model in machine learning is designed to automatically identify and classify handwritten digits, typically ranging from 0 to 9. It is often trained using a dataset like MNIST, which contains thousands of labeled images of handwritten digits. The model, usually built using algorithms such as neural networks or convolutional neural networks (CNNs), learns to extract features from the images, such as shapes and patterns, to recognize the digits accurately. Once trained, the model can predict the digit represented in new, unseen images. This technology is widely used in applications like postal code recognition, bank check processing, and automated form data entry.</p6><br><br><br>
