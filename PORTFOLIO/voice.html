<p5>A voice emotion recognition model in machine learning is designed to analyze speech and identify the emotional state of the speaker. It works by processing audio signals to extract features such as pitch, tone, speed, and intensity, which are indicative of different emotions like happiness, sadness, anger, or surprise. Using algorithms such as deep learning or support vector machines, the model is trained on labeled datasets containing various emotional speech samples. Once trained, it can classify emotions from new voice inputs, making it useful in applications like customer service, mental health monitoring, and interactive voice assistants.</p5><br><br><br>
