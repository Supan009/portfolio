<p4>A human-following robot using Arduino Uno is a type of robot that can detect and follow a person’s movements autonomously. It typically uses sensors like ultrasonic or infrared to detect obstacles and track the person’s position. The Arduino Uno microcontroller processes data from these sensors and controls the motors to guide the robot in following the person. The robot adjusts its movement based on the detected distance, ensuring it stays a specific distance away from the person. This project is an excellent way to learn about robotics, sensor integration, and motor control using Arduino.</p4><br><br><br>
