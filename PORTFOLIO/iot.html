<p1>Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to identify and extract subjective information from text data. It classifies text into categories such as positive, negative, or neutral, based on the emotions or opinions expressed. This application is widely used in areas like customer feedback analysis, social media monitoring, brand management, and market research. By analyzing sentiment, businesses can gain insights into customer opinions, track public sentiment on topics, and improve products or services based on user feedback. It can be implemented using machine learning models or rule-based approaches to process large volumes of text efficiently.</p1><br><br><br>
